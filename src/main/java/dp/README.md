# How to see if we need DP?

1) Repeated SubProblems or Overlapping SubProblems
2) Optimal SubStructure
    - if we want to compute optimal answer for the bigger problem, then if we have optimal answer for sub problem and they contribute optimally for the bigger problem so that optimal answer for the bigger problem can be constructed from optimal answer of sub problems.
